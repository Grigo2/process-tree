# process-tree
Code written in C language using Linux system functions (execl and sigaction structure).
## Description
A program that creates new processes that wait for the signal to end (SIGINT). Each new procces create his own procces group and if is possible divide argv[1] value and create two procces by execl. The SIGINT signal starts propagation from the main process.

## Example 
enter 'abcd' as a argument
